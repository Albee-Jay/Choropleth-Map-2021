# Choropleth-Map-2021
This is a Choropleth Map app, that I built for the FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization curriculum.

Your can see it live here: https://albee-jay.github.io/Choropleth-Map-2021/

This one was a tough project to get through, I stumbled a lot and then found a YouTube video which made the learning process a bit easier.

I wlecome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better.

Thank You, Albee-Jay
